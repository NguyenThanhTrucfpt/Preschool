                <div class="info">The European International School (EIS) offers a unique world class learning environment for children from 2 to 18 years of age. The School is fully accredited by the Council of International Schools (CIS), meaning that EIS meets the highest
                    possible international quality standards in all areas of school operations. It also means that other schools, colleges and universities recognise EIS students’ school reports and High School diploma as being issued by a high quality
                    school, held in good standing internationally. <br> <br>Our students acquire the skills and embrace the values of the IB learner profile within an enquiry based teaching and learning environment, enabling a smooth transition to other
                    schools, colleges and universities globally. We have a track record of academic excellence, of substantial scholarship offers, and a proven pathway to some of the best colleges and universities in the USA, the UK, Australia/New Zealand,
                    Europe and Asia. <br><br>Our beautiful tropical garden campus is warm and welcoming and students enjoy a ‘home away from home’ environment within 13 beautiful low-rise villas (our ‘educational village’). With 45+ nationalities represented,
                    our community is truly international; ensuring that every child has an enriching, engaging and challenging learning experience, helping them to become global citizens. Students are constantly encouraged to challenge themselves, to
                    take risks and to try new things (without the fear of failure), to learn to collaborate and work in teams, to care for others, to ask great questions, to research thoroughly and to reflect on personal actions. <br><br>Being a medium-sized
                    school, we are large enough to offer a full range of educational opportunities, while also being small enough to provide the unique individual attention and care that each child deserves.</div>

I personally believe that the true quality of the “educational village” lies in the independent and embracing environment that the school sustains. During my stay, I was able to take on new challenges and take numerous leadership roles. This overall developed me into an independent learner, better prepared to move forward for future chapters of my education.

In the IB curriculum, I was given opportunities to plan my own events and lead students to participate so I was able to easily determine my career path. Our teachers were very strict at first because they helped students create environments to lead their own learning or activities, but now that I think about it, it helped me learn the qualities of a true leader. Thanks to the many experience I had at EIS, I am now confident and proud to be in a college in the UK.

From this year our daugther Dua also joined the Toddlers class. We are really happy with our selection of this school as it provides a good protective nourishing envoirnment to all the students. Main reason of selecting EIS is the option of additional German language which no other International school in Saigon provides. And the thing we like most is almost all of the school staff know us and school wants involvement of parents at all events. </textarea>
